### Testing

To test crud api endpoint that has been created you can use **curl** utility. Before test, you must login
first to get jwt token and using it in every request header you sent.
```
curl -X POST localhost:5000/api/login -d '{"username":"admin@nj.net", "password":"enje123"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
``` 

CREATE API ENDPOINT
```
curl -X POST localhost:5000/api/user -d '{"username":"user1@nj.net", "password":"user1"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

READ API ENDPOINT
```
curl localhost:5000/api/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

UPDATE API ENDPOINT
```
curl -X PUT localhost:5000/api/user/<id> -d '{"username":"user01@nj.net", "password":"user01"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
